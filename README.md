🧪 Ligand Clustering for Bias Reduction and Robust ML Splits

This project provides a pipeline for clustering chemical ligands based on structural similarity. The motivation is to avoid bias in downstream analysis and ensure robust train/test splits when applying machine learning methods.
🔍 Problem Statement

In cheminformatics and molecular modeling, many ligands belong to the same chemical series (congeners). If members of the same cluster end up in both training and test datasets, this may lead to information leakage, model overfitting, and misleading performance metrics.

To mitigate this:

    We cluster similar ligands using fingerprint-based similarity.

    We then ensure that no cluster is split between train and test.

📓 Notebook

The full clustering workflow and group-aware data splitting are demonstrated in the Jupyter notebook:
📘 ecfp_cluster_split.ipynb

It includes:

    Molecular fingerprint generation (ECFP)

    KMeans clustering

    GroupKFold split that keeps clusters intact

    Visualization of clustering results


📊 Visualization

    Cluster assignments are visualized in the file below:
    📎 clustering.pdf

        The PDF is large and detailed — open it separately to explore all clusters and ligand assignments.

💡 Key Features

    Group-aware cross-validation (GroupKFold)

    Easy-to-extend modular structure (src/)

    Clean visualization utilities

    Reproducible and readable Jupyter pipeline

🚀 Getting Started

    Install required libraries (e.g. RDKit, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib) and run the notebook:
